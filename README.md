Unwaste
=======

Unwaste will be a webapp + server that makes it possible for users who find garbage
to pick it up and mark it as picked up. People can also spot garbage they can't
or don't want to pick up and other people can find these spots to pick it up
themselves.

Set up dev environment
======================

- Install Node JS
- Install MySQL
- Set up MySQL (see SQL commands in lib/api.js comments)
- Run "npm install"
- Run "npm install bower -g"
- Run "cd public/ && bower install && ln -s bower_components components"

Then simply start the server using "npm start"
